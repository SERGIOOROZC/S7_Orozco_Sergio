# About the proyect

## What is this project?
This is a JavaScript-based web application designed to help users manage daily tasks more efficiently. It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks using a clean and responsive user interface.

## Where does it work?
The project works on all modern web browsers. It is fully compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and can be deployed on any web server or GitHub Pages.

## How does it work?
The application uses vanilla JavaScript for core logic, HTML for structure, and CSS for styling. Tasks are stored in local storage, so users don’t need an account to start using the app.

## Who is it for?
It is designed for people who need a simple and fast task manager, especially students, remote workers, and developers who want to keep track of their to-dos.

## How often is it updated?
The project is updated once a month. Minor fixes and improvements are added regularly based on user feedback.

## What do we have?
We have a working prototype, a list of planned features, and a roadmap for future development. We also have documentation and basic tests.

## What did we have before?
Before starting this project, we had a paper-based task system. It was disorganized and hard to maintain. This app was created to solve that problem.

## What’s he doing now?
The main developer is currently improving the codebase and preparing the next version with cloud sync support.

## Do we have help?
Yes, we have two contributors and one project advisor helping with UI/UX design and code review
